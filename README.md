# 📉 Stock Market AI (That Didn't Work 😅)

## ❓ What is this?

An attempt to build a stock market prediction AI using code, vibes, and too much faith in large language models.

## 🧠 The Idea

The goal was to create an AI that could analyze stock data and predict prices or trends.

I used:
- Python
- Some libraries I didn’t fully understand
- A lot of ChatGPT help
- Very little actual knowledge about markets or machine learning

## 🧪 The Result

It doesn't work.  
At all.  
Like seriously — don't invest based on this.

## ⚠️ Why It Failed

- I didn’t understand how stock data works  
- I used AI to write most of the code without knowing what it was doing  
- It was more "vibe coding" than actual programming  
- Machine learning is hard without learning the "machine" part

## 💡 What I Learned

Even failed projects teach you something:
- AI is helpful but can’t replace real understanding
- ML models aren't magic
- Debugging nonsense teaches you more than getting it right on the first try

## 🔁 What’s Next?

Maybe I’ll try again after learning:
- How ML models work
- What a loss function even is
- How real stock prediction *shouldn’t* be done by beginners 😅
